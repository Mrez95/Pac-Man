Features

Developed a pac-man clone using an object orientated approach using Java. Whether you are competing with up to 4 friends for 
high scores in multiplayer mode or dueling it out with the computer AI in the single-player option there will always be some
fan-"pac"-stic action for everyone to enjoy!

Usage
------------

To preview simply download the ZIP through git and import the entire project to Greenfoot IDE. Compile, run it and play!
